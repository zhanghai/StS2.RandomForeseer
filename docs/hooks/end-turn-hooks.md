# End turn hooks

Simulation-facing hook facade: `InCombat/Mirrors/HookMirrors.cs`.

Mirror files:

- `InCombat/Mirrors/CombatMirrorContext.cs`
- `InCombat/Mirrors/Hooks/TurnEnd/AfterAutoPostPlayPhaseEnteredMirrors.cs`
- `InCombat/Mirrors/Hooks/TurnEnd/BeforeSideTurnEndMirrors.cs`
- `InCombat/Mirrors/Hooks/TurnEnd/OrichalcumMirrors.cs`

## Hook specs

- `AbstractModel.AfterAutoPostPlayPhaseEntered(PlayerChoiceContext, Player)`
- `AbstractModel.BeforeSideTurnEndVeryEarly(PlayerChoiceContext, CombatSide, IEnumerable<Creature>)`
- `AbstractModel.BeforeSideTurnEndEarly(PlayerChoiceContext, CombatSide, IEnumerable<Creature>)`
- `AbstractModel.BeforeSideTurnEnd(PlayerChoiceContext, CombatSide, IEnumerable<Creature>)`

## AfterAutoPostPlayPhaseEntered listeners

| Model | 中文名 | Original effect | Current mirror status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HowlFromBeyond` | 彼岸咆哮 | If in exhaust pile, auto-plays for owner. | Implemented for immediate auto-play damage through simulator `AutoPlay` and the shared `CardOnPlayMirrors` handler. |
| `IAmInvincible` | 所向无敌 | If top of owner draw pile, auto-plays from draw pile. | Implemented for draw-pile selection, play-pile movement, and immediate block gain through simulator `AutoPlayFromDrawPile` and the shared `CardOnPlayMirrors` handler. |
| `StampedePower` | 惊逃 | Auto-plays playable Attacks in hand. | Selects candidates with cloned `Shuffle` RNG and calls generic simulator `AutoPlay`; unsupported generic `OnPlay` bodies are risk-marked, so this remains a partial mirror until individual attack effects or full card-play simulation are supported. |

## BeforeSideTurnEndVeryEarly listeners

| Model | 中文名 | Original effect | Current mirror status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Orichalcum` | 奥利哈钢 | Records whether owner had no block before early end-turn block effects. | Implemented with state-store flag. |
| `FakeOrichalcum` | 奥利哈钢？？？ | Same as Orichalcum. | Implemented with state-store flag. |
| `AsleepPower` | 沉睡 | Removes Plating near wake-up timing. | Ignored. Power removal is unsupported and does not directly affect currently modeled predictions. |

## BeforeSideTurnEndEarly listeners

| Model | 中文名 | Original effect | Current mirror status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PlatingPower` | 覆甲 | Owner gains block before damage effects. | Implemented via `GainBlock`. |
| `RegenPower` | 再生 | If the owner is a living participant, heals owner by amount and decrements Regen. | Healing implemented via simulator `Heal` before normal side-turn-end effects such as Doom. Regen amount decrement is not persisted because no later hook in this simulation consumes it. |
| `PaelsEye` | 佩尔之眼 | If owner played no cards, exhausts all cards in hand before granting an extra turn. | Implemented for immediate hand exhaust and exhaust hooks; still marks risk because extra-turn scheduling is not modeled. |

## BeforeSideTurnEnd listeners

| Model | 中文名 | Original effect | Current mirror status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Orichalcum` | 奥利哈钢 | If very-early flag is set, owner gains block. | Implemented. |
| `FakeOrichalcum` | 奥利哈钢？？？ | Same as Orichalcum. | Implemented. |
| `CloakClasp` | 斗篷扣 | Owner gains block per card in hand. | Implemented. |
| `RippleBasin` | 波纹水盆 | Owner gains block if no Attack was played this turn. | Implemented. Uses live combat history like original. |
| `HailstormPower` | 冰雹风暴 | If owner has enough Frost orbs, damages all hittable enemies. | Implemented via `Damage`. |
| `ScreamingFlagon` | 尖叫酒壶 | If owner hand is empty, damages all hittable enemies. | Implemented via `Damage`. |
| `StoneCalendar` | 历石 | On configured turn, damages all hittable enemies. | Implemented via `Damage`. |
| `TheBombPower` | 炸弹 | At final countdown, damages all hittable enemies. | Implemented via `Damage`. |
| `DoomPower` | 灾厄 | Kills the first doomed creature on the side. | Risk only. Kill/death/combat-structure simulation is incomplete. |
| `Regret` | 悔恨 | Stores hand size so its turn-end-in-hand effect later deals unblockable self damage. | Implemented by storing the shadow hand size on the card's mutable preview for the `CardModel.OnTurnEndInHand` mirror. |
| `PaelsTears` | 佩尔之泪 | Gains energy. | Ignored. Energy does not affect current predictions. |
| `ChainsOfBindingPower` | 魂缚锁链 | Clears Bound from all cards and resets internal flag. | Implemented for mirror pile state by clearing Bound on `PredictedCard` previews. Live internal flag reset is not mutated. |
| `SandpitPower` | 沙坑 | Updates creature positions on enemy side turn end. | Ignored. Enemy-side positioning does not affect current player-turn predictions. |

## Parity notes

- StS2 v0.108.0 renamed the side-wide turn-end hooks from `BeforeTurnEnd` / `AfterTurnEnd` to `BeforeSideTurnEnd` / `AfterSideTurnEnd`. The simulator mirrors the player phase-one `BeforeSideTurnEnd` path; phase-two `AfterSideTurnEnd` remains outside this prediction surface.
- StS2 v0.109.0 removed `DiamondDiadem` from `BeforeSideTurnEnd` and deleted
  `DiamondDiademPower`. The relic now grants block and Blur at the first side-turn start, outside
  the current end-turn prediction surface, so it is no longer registered here.
- `Regret` records the shadow hand size on its mutable preview before ethereal cards are exhausted and before
  turn-end-in-hand wrappers move cards to the play pile, matching vanilla timing without mutating the real card's
  private counter.
- The end-turn simulator follows the prediction-relevant ordering of StS2 v0.110.0
  `CombatManager.EndPlayerTurnPhaseOneInternal`: auto-post-play hooks, `BeforeSideTurnEnd`, per-player orb triggers,
  ethereal exhaust, then turn-end-in-hand wrappers. The win-condition boundary after `BeforeSideTurnEnd` and the
  combat-ending check after each player's orb triggers are not yet mirrored; their call sites retain TODO markers for
  the planned centralized combat-ending checks.
- Vanilla next calls `BeforeFlush` for each ending player. Its only vanilla listener is `SlumberingEssence` (沉眠精华),
  which is not used by the current version of the base game, so the simulator omits this hook.
