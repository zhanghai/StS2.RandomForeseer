# Random Foreseer

Languages: [中文](README.md) | English

A random-outcome prediction mod for Slay the Spire 2. It previews selected RNG results without advancing the real game RNG, without needing to Save & Load.

Changelog: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

Steam Workshop: [Random Foreseer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3747531952)

The Workshop package automatically loads the newest compatible Mod version for the running game version; GitHub Releases provide a standard single-version package.

## Features

- **Transform prediction**: shows the exact card that the current RNG state will produce in transform selection grid hover tips and confirmation previews.
- **Random-card-generation potion prediction**: adds the predicted generated cards to random-card-generation potion hover tips.
- **Potion generation prediction**: shows the potions that Entropic Brew and Alchemize will generate.
- **Combat card generation prediction**: shows predicted generated cards when hovering supported random-card generators in hand during combat.
- **Chained card-effect prediction**: when enabled, combat card prediction also shows supported card and combat effects caused indirectly by the played card, with causal explanations.
- **Combat card selection prediction**: shows or highlights existing cards that supported combat card-selection effects will select when hovering cards in hand or card-play targets; predictions that may be shifted by side effects show a warning that can be disabled.
- **Random-target attack prediction**: shows targets that supported random-enemy attack cards will hit during combat, with health bar forecasts.
- **Orb effect prediction**: shows targets that supported orb-triggering cards and potions will hit when hovering those sources or their targets during combat, with health bar forecasts.
- **End-turn effect prediction**: shows aggregated supported end-turn damage for all players ending their turn; overlay indicators and health bar forecasts can be configured separately for End Turn button hover or always during the player turn; hovering a target creature or prediction indicator shows per-hit damage source details.
- **Draw-pile autoplay prediction**: shows the cards that Havoc, Cascade, and Distilled Chaos will play from the draw pile.
- **Potion draw prediction**: shows the cards that supported draw potions will draw, including cards after shuffle.
- **Card draw prediction**: shows the cards that supported card-play draw effects such as Reboot and Calculated Gamble will draw, including cards after shuffle.
- **Combat transform prediction**: shows the cards that Entropy will transform selected hand cards into during combat.
- **Driftwood reroll prediction**: shows the cards that a card reward reroll will offer when hovering the Reroll button.
- **Pael's Wing sacrifice prediction**: shows the relic awarded by an activating Sacrifice button.
- **Relic pickup effect prediction**: relic tooltips (including Ancient options) show random cards, relics, potions, curses, and transform results that happen immediately on pickup.
- **Rest-site result prediction**: shows random results from relics such as Dream Catcher, Tiny Mailbox, and Shovel when hovering rest-site options.
- **Event option prediction**: shows immediate random rewards, random upgrades/downgrades, and random follow-up options when hovering non-Ancient event options.
- **Crystal Sphere clairvoyance**: shows item locations and types through unrevealed fog in the Crystal Sphere minigame.
- **Next Act Ancient and boss prediction**: the top bar on boss reward screens in the first two Acts shows the next Act's starting Ancient and ending boss.
- **Frozen Eye**: shows the combat draw pile in actual draw order when opened, and previews the discard pile order after shuffle during the player's turn.

Each feature can be toggled independently from the mod settings page, and predictions can also be disabled globally for singleplayer or multiplayer. Fair mode is enabled by default and limits predictions to information obtainable through Save & Load.

## Build From Source

Before the first build, copy the local path configuration:

```powershell
Copy-Item .\local.props.template .\local.props
```

Configure these values in `local.props`:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `Sts2Dir` | Slay the Spire 2 install directory |
| `Sts2DataDir` | Game DLL directory, usually `$(Sts2Dir)/data_sts2_windows_x86_64` |
| `GodotExe` | MegaDot/Godot executable used to export the PCK |
| `RitsuLibDeployDir` | Local RitsuLib deployment directory |

Common build command:

```powershell
dotnet build .\RandomForeseer.csproj
```

Validate C# compilation only, without copying to the game directory or exporting a PCK:

```powershell
dotnet build .\RandomForeseer.csproj /p:RunPckExport=false /p:CopyModOnBuild=false
```

A full build deploys the DLL, manifest, and PCK to `$(Sts2Dir)/mods/RandomForeseer`.
